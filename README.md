Attempting to replicate deep autoencoding gaussian mixture model for anomaly detection

The aim is to understand how we can combine autoencoders with Gaussian mixture models for anomaly detection and how to develop this method further.

The first step is to attempt to replicate the work already done on this in the following paper.
[1] B. Zong et al., “Deep Autoencoding Gaussian Mixture Model for Unsupervised Anomaly Detection,” in ICLR, 2018.

The code has been created with reference to the following repositories:
